# 🧪 SDP Cypress Automation

This repository contains **end-to-end (E2E) test automation** for the [SDP Frontend](https://github.com/cerenazr/sdp_frontend) project.  
It has been structured as an **independent Cypress test suite** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and CI/CD compatibility.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

During the **Software Realization & Testing** course, the testing infrastructure for the SDP project was developed using Cypress.  
This demo focuses on the first successful E2E test scenario — validating both happy and negative paths.

**Core Goals:**
- Validate UI and functional behavior of the frontend.  
- Automate manual test scenarios with reproducible results.  
- Generate visual and video evidence of test runs.
